Platform-Feature-Wishlist
=========================
This May be better done in a Spreadsheet, which, then we can use to compare various platforms. This will work for now.

The top-level bullet is the feature, and the sub-bullets indicate reasons:

* Tagging that allows allow for drill down hierarchies to form.
     Allows a file to be found through multiple different associative network without having to keep multiple copies of a file.
    
* Syncing/Updating of files in different locations.
     Similar to above, allows a file to updated across many locations. Prevents the necessity of finding the perfect place for the file to be found.
    
* The ability to create infinitely nested folder structures.
     Obviously, for organization of topic/sub.
    
* Integration of folder structures with native file-systems
     Allows for more access and easier migration. ( Wheel-Chair Ramps)
    
* Revision Histories
     Documentation of RAW data changes over-time. Can be used, for example, to do processes analysis.
    
* Meta-Commenting System
     Comment on file without changing the file itself. Allows for conversation about what is being done to happen.
    
    Multiple accounts working on a file at once.
       Obvious efficiency and collaboration purposes.
    
    Easy indication who is making which changes to a file
       Obvious credential purposes.
    
    Embedding of files in other medium
       Distribution purposes
    
    Cross-platform
       Does anything need to be said?
